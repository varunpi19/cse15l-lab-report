# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)

## I will be explaining how these 3 basic filesystem commands work through example: 

* cd
* ls
* cat

## I will be exploring these commands through these 3 questions:

1) **What happends when we use the command with no arguments?**



2) **What happends when we use the command with a path to a directory as an argument**



3) **What happends when we use the command with a path to a file as an argument**
